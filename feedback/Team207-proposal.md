 * This seems like a useful crowdsourcing tool, especially here at CMU. My one concern is that the base application seems a bit simple to implement (kind of like Grumblr) for a group of 3 people, so I would make sure that you differentiate it by including your reach goals. Some suggestions would be to focus on a few functionalities (more important ones, like driving servives and tutoring) and make sure tha the application works very well for that first before worrying about other things. I think using API's will be essential to making this project work. You mentioned using Twilio for text messaging, which seems almost essential in a webapp like this. You might also want to look into Google Wallet to handle transactions.

 * This is an interesting idea. I could see it using payment-based APIs and calendar-based APIs in addition to the Google Maps API that you've listed. You could even go so far as to implement calling in your web app so users can talk to each other through webcam or microphone when they need to contact each other. This would be a lot more interesting than using direct messaging. Since users need to be vetted, it might make sense to add logging in via Facebook OAuth to the app as well.

 * This sounds like an interesting idea but the features that you guys suggested are quite simliar to Grumblr. I would definitely consider exploring/adding more interesting webapp features. One idea would be to add a more complex matching system. Right now, a receiver simply contacts the helper to ask for help. Maybe you can add an actual transaction sytem that utilizes third party APIs like Google Wallet.
