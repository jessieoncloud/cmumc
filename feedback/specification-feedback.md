Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: be19595c70d9c5dfb4d878427ba6d101c5274b93

### The product backlog (10/10)

* You should have included a clear assignment of responsibility for each feature, to the student or students on the team who will complete that feature. Each student should have sole responsibility for some features on the overall project.
* You should have included a cost estimate for each feature, in hours.  If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours, you should consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve your ability to track progress on it.

### Data models (10/10)

* How can a "type" be a boolean? This seems like it should be some sort of enum or category relationship.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)

* Nice job!

### Additional Information

* Why do the receiver and helper modes need to be changed with a "mode switch". Couldn't the pages just be available to every user?
* If you plan on integrating with Google Calendar, allowing users to log in with Google OAuth will be pretty easy.
